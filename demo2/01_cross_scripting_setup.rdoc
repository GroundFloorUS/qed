= Cross-Scripting Setup

We define some variables here to make sure it is
not visible in the next script.

Let's set two local variables.

  a = 100
  b = 200

And two instance varaibles.

  @a = 1000
  @b = 2000

What about the common constant?

  COMMON_CONSTANT.assert == "common"

And the common method?

  common_method.assert == "common"
