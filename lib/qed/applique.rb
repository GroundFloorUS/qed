  # Applique is a module built per-script from the +applique+ directory.
  # Applique scripts are loaded at the start of a session.

  # *The Applique* is the whole collection of appliques that apply to given
  # demonstrandum. The applique that apply are the scripts located in the
  # directory relative to the demonstrandum script and all such directories
  # above this upto and the project's root directory.
  #
  # All scripts in the Applique must be compatible/consistant. For two demos to
  # have separate applique they must be kept in separate directories.
