= Compact Documents

While nicely spaced demonstrandum are nicer to read (IHO)
QED should be able to handle tight-knit demos like this.


And what about this.
  x = 10

  y = 20
Lets see if the it asserts.
  x.assert = 10
Okay.

And what about this:

  1 + 1

How about a text example ...

  This is some shit!

And another with triple quotes...

  """
  Try this
  man

  man
  """

Okay?
