  # The Applique is the environment of libraries required by
  # and the rules to apply to demonstrandum. The applique is
  # defined by a set of scripts located in the +applique+ 
  # directory of the upper-most test directory relative to
  # the tests run and below the root of a project. All
  # applique scripts are loaded at the start of a test
  # session. Thus all demos belong to one and only one
  # applique, and all the scripts in an applique must be
  # compatible/consistant. For two demos to have separate
  # applique they must be kept in separate directores.

    # This is useful to transform human readable code examples

    # shelle examples:
    #
    #    $ cp fixture/a.rb fixture/b.rb
    #
    # You can use a transform to convert lines starting with '$'
    # into executable Ruby using #system.
