= Embedded Rules

== Via Code

We can define's for this script by adding
a rule via code.

  When 'this is cool' do |match, text|
    @text = text
  end

Now, let's try it by saying, "this is cool":

  And this is the text.

Did it work?

  @text.assert == "And this is the text."


== Via Text

When: Let #/\w+/ be ... scared of #/\w+/

  @text    = match[0]
  @name    = match[1]
  @monster = match[2]

Okay let's try it.

Let John be very scared of Zombies.

So now what is the name?

  @name.assert == "John"

What is the monster?

  @monster.assert == "Zombies"

And the who text?

  @text.assert == "Let John be very scared of Zombies"

Did it work?
