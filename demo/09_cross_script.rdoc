= Cross-Scripting Check

Make sure local and instance variables from previous
QED scripts are not visible in this document.

  expect NameError do
    a.assert = 100
    b.assert = 200
  end

And two instance_varaibles

  @a.assert! == 1000
  @b.assert! == 2000


Method definitions also do not cross QED scripts.

  expect NameError do
    cross_script_method
  end

Constants, on the other hand, like global variables do make
their way across.

  CROSS_SCRIPT_CONSTANT.assert == "cross?"
