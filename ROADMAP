= ROADMAP

== 2.2.0

* Simplify code. I do not think we need both an Evaluator and Scope classes.

== 2.3.0

* Add a distributed evaluator, probably using Drb. This will allow the code
portion of documents to run in an isolated process. It will also make it possible
(in the long run) to run tests in parallel acrosss a cluster.
