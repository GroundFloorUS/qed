== Introduction

Q.E.D. stands for Quality Enhanced Demos. QED is an easy to use
quality assurance and documentation system for Ruby Developers.
QED sit between low-level testing tools like Test Unit and 
requirements specifications like Cucumber. It is designed to
address Interface-driven devleopment, which is especailly 
useful when designing reusble libraries.


== Features

* Demos can be RDoc or Markdown format. 
* Uses AE as backend assertion system.


== Synopsis

=== Assertion Syntax

QED uses AE (Assertive Expressions) libary to provide an elegant means of
express behaviors. To give a quck overview, you can use code such as:

    4.should == 5

In this example, because 4 != 5, this expression will raise an Assertion
exception. QED's Runner class is thus just a means of running and capturing
code block containing these assertions.

You can learn more about AE at http://proutils.rubyforge/ae.

=== Document Structure

QED documents are simply text files --thus a practice of literal programming.
For example:

    # Example

    Shows that the number 5 does not equal 4.

        5.should! == 4

    But in fact equals 5.

        5.should == 5

As you can see, we used Markdown for this document. Almost any text format
can be used. The only neccesary distinction is that desciption text be
align to the left margin and all code be indented. However QED recognizes
RDoc and Markdown style headers, so any format that supports this style
(which covers many markup formats in use today) will work a bit better.
While strictly speaking QED does not need to recognize headers, it does
improve console output a bit.

Give this design some thought. It should become clear that this approach is
especially fruitful in that it allows *documentation* and *specification*
to seemlessly merge into a unified *demonstraion*.

If we run this document through QED in verbatim mode the output would be
identical (assuming we did not make a typo and the assertions passed).
If there were errors or failures, we would see information detaling each.

=== Running Demonstrations

To run a document through QED, simply use the +qed+ command.

  $ qed demo/01_example.rdoc

Notice we placed the QED document in the demo directory, this is the
traditional place we have designated for them, though you can put them
elsewhre in your project if you prefer. Also notice the 01_ in front
of the name. While this is not necessary, it helps order the documents
properly with generatingQED documentation (QEDocs).

Speaking of which, to generate documentation from QED documents, use the
+qedoc+ command. Eg.

  $ qed --output site/qedoc --title "Example" demo/*.rdoc

Use the +--help+ options on each command to get more inforamtion on the
use of these commands.
