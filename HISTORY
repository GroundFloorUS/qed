= RELEASE HISTORY

== 2.1.1 / 2010-04-08

Fixed bug introduced in the last version that executed all
scripts in a single binding. There needed to be a binding
for each script.

Changes:

* Fixed cross-script bug by moving binding instantiation into Script class.


== 2.1.0 / 2010-04-07

QED documents are now run in the TOPLEVEL context, rather
than in a subclass of Scope. This ensures code runs as
one would expect it too in the wild.

Changes:

* Scope.new redirect to TOPLEVEL.
* DomainLanguage module is added to include into TOPLEVEL.


== 2.0.0 / 2010-03-04

This is a major new release of QED. All demonstration documents
are now converted to HTML via Tilt (http://github.com/tilt) before
being run through the test runner. So QED now supports any markup
format supported by Tilt, as well as ordinary HTML. Simply
stated, QED process <tt>pre</tt> tags as code and everything else
as comments. Nokogiri is used to parse the HTML.

Changes:

* HTML serves as a common format.
* New dependencies: Tilt and Nokogiri.
* New system of version numbers.


== 1.2 / 2009-12-07

This release adds a significant new feature, Comment Matchers.
These work like Cucumber allowing for background code to
be run when matching comments occur --a much better solution
for setup and teardown.

* 2 Major Enhancements

  * Added command matchers via #When method.
  * All QED methods are now capitalized.

* 2 Minor Enhancements

  * Use OptionParser for qed exectuable.

== 1.0 / 2009-06-30

perpective.
