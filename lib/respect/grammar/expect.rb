    module Expect

      # The +expect+ method is a powerful tool for defining
      # expectations in your specifications.
      #
      # Like #should it can be used to Designate an expectation
      # via a *functor*. 
      #
      #   4.expect == 3
      #
      # Or it can be used in block form.
      #
      #   expect(4){ 3 }
      #
      # This compares the expected value and the actual
      # value with <i>broad equality</i>. This is similar to
      # case equality (#===) but also checks other forms of
      # equality. See the #equate method.
      #
      # Of particluar utility is that #expect allows one to
      # specify if the block raises the error.
      #

      #     not_a_method
