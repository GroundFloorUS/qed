= Helpers

There are two ways to load advice scripts. Either per
demonstration or globally. Per demonstration helpers 
apply only to the current demonstration. Global helpers
apply to all demonstrations.

== Global Helpers

Global helpers are loaded at the start of a session and
apply equally to all demonstrations in a suite. Global
helpers are simply Ruby scripts and are placed in an
+environment+ subdirectory. For instance this document
is used <a href="environment/env.rb">environment/env.rb</a>.

== Local Helpers

Helper scripts can be written just like demonstration scripts,
or they can be defined as pure Ruby scripts. Either way
they are loaded per-demonstration by using specially
marked links.

For example, because this link, Advice[qed://helpers/advice.rb],
begins with +qed:+, it will be used to load a global
helper. We can see this with the following:

  pudding.assert.include?('load advice.rb')

No where in the demonstration have we  defined +pudding+, but
it has been defined for us in the advice.rb helper script.

We can also see that the generic When clause in our advice
helper is keeping count of descriptions. Since the helper
script was loaded three paragraphs back, the count will be 3.

  count.assert == 3

Helpers are vital to building test-demonstration suites for
applications. But here again, only use them as necessary.
The more helpers you use the more difficult your demos will
be to follow.
