= Quotes

We do not always want verbatum clauses to be interpreted as code.
Sometimes it would more useful to trest them a plan text to 
which the preceeding paragraph can make use in a processing rule.

For example let say we want to make an example out of the following
text...

  The file will contain

  this text

The use of the ellipsis ('...') tells the processor that the next
segment is a continuation of the current segment. If the next segment
is varbatum it will be added to the end of the arguments list of
any applicable processing rule.

Behind the scenes we created a rule to set the text to an instance
variable called @quote_text, as we can now verify:

  @quote_text.assert == "The file will contain\n\nthis text"
